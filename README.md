         <h3> What is Chess? </h3>
           <p> <i> Chess </i>, as many know it, incorporates six distinct pieces, each with a unique role that, when together, are necessary for victory. Sides of black and white are taken before the match begins; the pieces are named from the following: the pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and king.</p>
           <ul>
             <li> the <strong> pawn </strong> = 1 point</li>
             <li> the <strong> knight </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>bishop </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>rook</strong> = 5 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>queen</strong> = 9 poInts </li>
             <li> the <strong>king</strong> = âˆž points; the target </li>
           </ul>
  <h4> What are openings?</h4>
    <p> Openings are defined as chess <em> theory</em>. They are studied, put into practice, and often repeated in the thousands, hence they are given names via the creator. Openings are comprised of moves called "<strong>book moves</strong>."<br> It is strongly encouraged for chess beginners to learn openings, by studying separate variations; do not expect to know every move, since some variations are commonly irrelevant in certain ratings and will likely not be put into use. </p>
    <div id="Vienna">
      <h2> The Vienna Game </h2>
      <p> The opening moves to the Vienna goes as follows: </p>
        <ol> 
          <li> e4   e5 </li>
          <li> Nc3 </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="">
        <p> In an unorthodox manner (for beginners), White plays the move <em> Nc3 </em> (see above). These moves are the foundation for the Vienna, as it can transpire into multiple variations. </p>
    </div>
        <h3> Vienna Gambit </h3>
        <p> After the following steps (above), black can play <em> Nf6 </em>. An immediate follow-up that starts the Gambit is <em> f4 </em>. </p>
        <img src="">
        <p> If black takes (inaccuracy), push the <em> e </em> pawn to kick out the knight; it is forced to move back to its original square, or capture it for free otherwise. Develop normally and eventually win back the pawn.</p>
        <img src="">
        <p> If black plays Qe7, pinning the pawn to the king and preventing it from capturing the knight, play Qe2 in response. The knight is, then, forced to return to its original square. Develop normally. </p>
        <h4> Brilliant Line:</h4>
        <p> If black, on the next move, plays d6, kicking out the pawn in the center, immediately strike with Nd5, attacking the king. If black doesn't defend its c7 square with its queen, it will lose material from a fork (checking the king, threatening the rook). If the opponent doesn't know this line, they will probably move their queen back, protecting the c7 square. </p>
        <img src=>
          <p> Then strike with the move Knight takes c7 anyways, and if black doesn't take the "free" knight, it will fall victim to a fork. </p>
        <img src=>
      <p> Once black plays Qxc7, take the d pawn with the e pawn, leading to a discovered check (since the queen is on the e file). The king is forced to move while their queen is being attacked, so white simply captures the free queen and eventually goes on to win the game. </p>
      <h3> Vienna Game: Copycat Variation </h3>
      <p>If the order of moves goes as follows...</p>
      <ol>
        <li> e4   e5 </li>
        <li> Nc3   Nc6 </li>
        <li> Bc4   Bc5 </li>
      </ol>
      <p> play Qg4, threatening the weak g7 pawn. 
        <img src=>
        As you can see, the copycat variation looks exactly as it sounds like; the lines can get tricky, but white is in a winning position. </p>
