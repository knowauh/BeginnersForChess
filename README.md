         <h3> What is Chess? </h3>
           <p> <i> Chess </i>, as many know it, incorporates six distinct pieces, each with a unique role that, when together, are necessary for victory. Sides of black and white are taken before the match begins; the pieces are named from the following: the pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and king.</p>
           <ul>
             <li> the <strong> pawn </strong> = 1 point</li>
             <li> the <strong> knight </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>bishop </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>rook</strong> = 5 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>queen</strong> = 9 poInts </li>
             <li> the <strong>king</strong> = objectively the most valuable piece on the board; targeted for victory </li>
           </ul>
  <h4> What are openings?</h4>
    <p> Openings are defined as chess <em> theory</em>. They are studied, put into practice, and often repeated in the thousands, hence they are given names. The origins of these openings are from individuals of higher rating, in which the moves played at the start of a game are called "<strong>book moves</strong>."<br>Chess beginners are strongly encouraged to learn such openings, expanding on their knowledge about certain book moves; do not expect to know every move, since some variations are commonly irrelevant in certain ratings and will likely not be put into use. </p>
