         <h3> What is Chess? </h3>
           <p> <i> Chess </i>, as many know it, incorporates six distinct pieces, each with a unique role that, when together, are necessary for victory. Sides of black and white are taken before the match begins; the pieces are named from the following: the pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and king.</p>
           <ul>
             <li> the <strong> pawn </strong> = 1 point</li>
             <li> the <strong> knight </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>bishop </strong>= 3 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>rook</strong> = 5 points </li>
             <li> the <strong>queen</strong> = 9 poInts </li>
             <li> the <strong>king</strong> = âˆž points: objectively the most valuable piece on the board; targeted for victory </li>
           </ul>
  <h4> What are openings?</h4>
    <p> Openings are defined as chess <em> theory</em>. They are studied, put into practice, and often repeated in the thousands, hence they are given names via the creator. Openings are comprised of moves called "<strong>book moves</strong>."<br> It is strongly encouraged for chess beginners to learn openings, studying separate variations; do not expect to know every move, since some variations are commonly irrelevant in certain ratings and will likely not be put into use. </p>

      <h2> The Vienna Game </h2>
      <p> The opening moves to the Vienna goes as the following: </p>
        <ol> 
          <li> e4   e5 </li>
          <li> Nc3 </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="">
        <p> In an unorthodox manner (for beginners), White plays the move <em> Nc3 </em> (see above). These moves are the foundation for the Vienna, as it can transpire into multiple variations. </p>
