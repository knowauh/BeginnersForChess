         <h3> What is Chess? </h3>
           <p> <strong> Chess </strong>, as many know it, incorporates six distinct pieces, each with a unique role that, when together, are necessary for victory. Sides of black and white are taken before the match begins; the pieces are named from the following: the pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and king.</p>
           <ul>
             <li> the <strong> pawn </strong> = 1 point</li>
             <li> the knight = 3 points </li>
             <li> the bishop = 3 points </li>
             <li> the rook = 5 points </li>
             <li> the queen = 9 ponts </li>
             <li> the king = objectively the most valuable piece on the board; targeted for victory </li>
           </ul>
